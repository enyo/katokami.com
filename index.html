      <h1>About Katokami</h1>

      <p>
        The team behind Katokami is based in Vienna, Austria and consists of only two people. Alex is the founder and
        creative head of Katokami while Claudia is responsible for marketing and communciations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alex started to create selfmade papercraft designs a while back because he looked for a way to bring digital
        3D-designs to life. He soon fell back in love with an almost forgotten crafting technique he last experienced
        as a child in the late 1980ies. Its called paper crafting.
      </p>

      <p>
        His early designs were such a success that he went on and founded his own papercraft label Katokami in 2013.
        His goal was not only to recreate the particular crafting experience of his childhood but to enhance it in
        numerous ways to make it attractive and accessible to a modern audience.

      <p>
        The word Katokami is Japanese and (roughly) translates to “cut paper”. The name and overall style of Katokami
        is inspired by Asian paper culture, like Origami and Kirigami for example. Simple, reduced shapes and modest
        use of color are main characteristics. Like with Origami, the central idea behind Katokami is the
        do-it-yourself spirit. “The way is the goal” so to speak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Katokamis papercraft kits come in different forms, sizes and colors. You have the choice between paper flowers,
        animals, masks, toys as well as street art and videogame inspired designs. Always included are detailed
        instruction manuals that show you step-by-step how to assemble the kit of your choice. It's easy!
