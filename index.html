<p id="intro">
  Do it yourself is the basic idea behind the KATOKAMI label.
  KATOKAMI papercraft kits are unique in their distinctive 'polygonal' look
  and the fun and easy assembly.
  Pre-cut and engraved sheets of paper reduce the time needed for putting a
  model together and help to capture the essence of paper crafting: the joy
  of creating something with your own hands.
